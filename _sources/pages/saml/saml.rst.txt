SAML
====

:ref:`Security Assertion Markup Language <glosssaml>` (SAML) is an XML-based, open-standard data format for securely exchanging information about identities.  


SAML can be used as the basis of a system of federated identity. This allows entities within a federation to refer to a user's electronic identity, even if it is managed differently by each entity. 

.. rubric:: Why does GOV.UK Verify use SAML?

GOV.UK Verify uses SAML to securely exchange information within a federated system of identity.

SAML is a mature standard and is widely used by industry.  SAML libraries and components are available for most programming languages and platforms.  
 

.. rubric:: What do you need to do?


You must :ref:`build a government service <SAMLintegration>` that sends SAML authentication requests to, and receives SAML responses from, the GOV.UK Verify hub. To do this, you need to understand :ref:`how SAML works with GOV.UK Verify <samlWorks>` and :ref:`decide how to add the SAML funcionality to your service <samlIntegrationtool>`.

When you build your service, you must :ref:`run SAML compliance tests <samlComplianceTool>`.

For more information, see :ref:`steps`.

.. _saml_docs:

You must adhere to the following specifications and guidance:

* '`Identity Assurance Hub Service SAML 2.0 Profile <https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-assurance-hub-service-saml-20-profile>`_' – describes the SAML specifications you must respect to connect to the GOV.UK Verify hub
* '`Identity Assurance Hub Service Profile – Authentication Contexts <https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-assurance-hub-service-profile-authentication-contexts>`_' – describes how the level of assurance is specified
* '`Identity Assurance Hub Service Profile – SAML Attributes <https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-assurance-hub-service-profile-saml-attributes>`_' – describes the matching dataset attributes and fraud event assertion attributes
* '`GOV.UK Verify guidance <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/identity-assurance/index.html>`_'

The SAML profile used by GOV.UK Verify builds on the `OASIS documentation for the SAML 2.0 standard <https://www.oasis-open.org/standards#samlv2.0>`_.
