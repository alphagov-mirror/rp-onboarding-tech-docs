Matching Service
========================

The purpose of a matching service is to find a match between a user’s verified identity and a record in a government service’s data sources. It allows the government service to be sure that the Jane Smith trying to access the service is the same Jane Smith already held on file.

Government services host their matching service within their security domain. A matching service is composed of the :ref:`Matching Service Adapter <msa>` and a local matching service.

.. rubric:: Why does GOV.UK Verify use a matching service? 

UK citizens do not have a unique identifier. Government services need to match other information about the user, for example address or date of birth, against their data sources.


.. rubric:: What do you need to do?

As a government service, it's your responsibility to develop and build your own local matching service. 

We're aware that some services don't have experience of matching verified identities to government data sources, and that the process can be complex. You need to understand :ref:`how a matching service works <msWorks>` and :ref:`how to build a local matching service <msBuild>`. If your service needs further help with building a local matching service, contact your engagement lead or the `GOV.UK Verify team <http://rp-environment-request.ida.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/contact_form>`_.
