.. _envRequestform:

Request access to environments
===============================

To access the integration and production environments, fill in the 'Request access to an environment' form. Your GOV.UK Verify engagement lead provides this form subject to successful gate reviews. You'll access the integration environment during `Stage 4 <http://alphagov.github.io/identity-assurance-documentation/stage4/Stage4.html>`_  and the production environment during `Stage 5 <http://alphagov.github.io/identity-assurance-documentation/stage5/Stage5.html>`_.

.. note:: Please allow up to 5 working days for the GOV.UK Verify team to set up and configure access to an environment.

Before filling in the form, you must :ref:`obtain signed certificates <pkiRequestCert>` from the appropriate certificate authority.

First select the environment you want to access: integration or production. If you're requesting access to the production environment, you need to fill in the entire form again as information from your integration environment will differ and is not carried over. 

The form provides guidance on what's required by the service.
